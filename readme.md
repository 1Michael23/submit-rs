# Prepare any file for submission

I coded this in about 20 minutes for university

All it does is copy a file to a directory and prepend customizable student number and name, (customized before compilation)

### Usage

```
$ submit assignment2.rs
```

result is the file 'studentnumber_last_first_assignment2.rs' in the specified directory.
